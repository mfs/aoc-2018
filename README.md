My solutions in Rust. Concentrating on writing idiomatic Rust and using
efficient algorithms.

## Benchmarks

To calculate benchmark times run `./benchmark.sh` from the top directory. This
will build release versions of each puzzle and then execute them collecting
timing information.

	Times
	----------------------------------------
	target/release/p1: 19ms
	target/release/p2: 2ms

	Total time: 21ms
